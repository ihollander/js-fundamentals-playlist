# Javascript Fundamentals

This README is meant to compile all the resources in one place for your first weekend learning Javascript.

Your primary source material for the weekend will be a series of Scrimba videos, which are linked in the sections below.

There are also some recommended assignments you have access to on Canvas to give you some hands-on practice with the topics covered in the videos. The JS Fundaments assignments are mixed throughout several sections within the Phase 3 material; so you'll find notes below on which assignments to prioritize. 

It's important to use the assignments to practice writing Javascript code, so don't skip out; but you also aren't expected to complete all the assignments. 

## What You Should Know In Week 1

Your goal for the first weekend should be to familiarize yourself with these topics:

- Variable assignment (*easy*)
  - using `const` vs `let`
- Function syntax (*easy*)
  - differences from Ruby methods
  - `return` keyword
- Type conversion and type equality (*easy*)
  - converting a string to a number
  - `==` vs `===`
- Control Flow (*easy*)
  - `if`/`else` conditionals
- Data types (*medium*)
  - differences between Primitive vs Non-Primitive data types
  - Object references
- Array iteration (*medium*)
  - using `forEach` with a callback function
  - similarities/differences with Ruby iteration
- Callback functions (*medium/hard*)
  - function definition/reference vs function invocation
  - callback signature
- Scope rules (*medium/hard*)
  - accessing external variables from inside a function
- Closure (*hard*)
  - working with nested functions
  - working with variable scope in a nested function

It may seem like a lot, but most of these concepts should be familiar from Ruby (and from the Bootcamp Prep track before Mod 1).

## Scrimba Videos

Recommended Assignments:

- Manipulating the DOM
  - 📖 Introducing The DOM And Just Enough JavaScript
  - 📖 JS Fundamentals: Variables
  - ✏️ JS Fundamentals: Variables Lab
  - 📖 JS Fundamentals: Arrays
  - ✏️ JS Fundamentals: Arrays Lab

*NOTE*: Callbacks, scope, and closures are tricky concepts! Don't expect them to make total sense the first time you watch these videos. Watch them once to get acquainted, and come back to them when you've had more time with Javascript to reinforce your understanding.
