# Intro to JS Fundamentals

Welcome to this tutorial series on Javascript fundamentals! We'll cover all the basics of the Javascript language first, then we'll get into some of the trickier bits like working with callback functions, scopes and closures, and some of the things that make Javascript a challenging but rewarding language to master.

## Using Scrimba

I'm recording these tutorials on Scrimba, which lets you pause the video and play around with the code I'm writing. Let's try that out now!

Try pausing the video now and changing this code to display your name instead of mine. Then click the 'Run' button in the upper-right corner to execute your code.

```js
const name = "Ian"
console.log(`Welcome to Scrimba, ${name}!`)
```

For this series, we'll just be exploring Javascript by running code in the console (so you'll see a lot of `console.log` statements). You can also use Javascript to interact with a webpage, but first it's important to get a handle on the fundamentals.

## Getting Help 

There are a couple resources I'll recommend for your Javascript journey. First and foremost, if you ever need to get more info on JS (like 'how does this method work'), the best place to turn is MDN (the Mozilla Developer Network):

Bookmark this site; and make sure to make it a part of your Google searches; and you'll be rewarded well!

Also, proper formatting and style is important in Javascript since it can easily become a hellscape of nested curly parens, so make sure to take time to properly indent/format your code. If you want some opinionated guidelines on how to format your code, look at the style guide from Airbnb:
